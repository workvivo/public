# Workvivo Unwired Users One-Time Passcode Sample

This repository contains sample code for [Workvivo's APIs: Unwired Users One-Time Passcodes](https://developer.workvivo.com/#aa34c835-aefb-4ff4-b1ad-232d00d37a9a).

## Quick Start

You do **not** need to create a new key pair to run the sample codeâ€”keys are already provided and registered with `unwired.workvivo.red`.
**However, for your own Workvivo environments, you must generate and register your own key pair.**

> **Security Note:**
> Never share your private keys. Always generate a unique key pair for each Workvivo organisation.
